    [name] => Tokomaru Bay Freezing Works Ruins
    [description] => The Tokomaru Bay Freezing Works opened in 1911 and quickly became a vital part of the local economy. Processing sheep and cattle for export, the works provided jobs for many families, especially from the surrounding Māori communities. At its peak, it was a centre of industry and life for Tokomaru Bay. Changing economic conditions and improvements in transport eventually led to its closure in 1952. Today, the remains of the freezing works stand as a tribute to the generations of workers who built a proud chapter in the bay’s history.
